# Creation

This application is intended to showcase a Rails/PostgreSQL backend and a React frontend.
It was initially created using `rails` command line generators and migrators.

    rails new foodporn --api --database=postgresql --webpack=react
    rails db:create

Then the Semantic UI CSS was installed for styling

    yarn add semantic-ui-css
